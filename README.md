Real-Time Face Recognition System
Overview
The Real-Time Face Recognition System is a powerful, machine learning-based application designed for accurate face recognition using OpenCV’s Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) algorithm. It leverages a custom dataset of facial images for training the model and enables real-time detection and identification of faces through a camera feed.

This system can be used for various purposes, including security applications, attendance systems, and personal projects where face recognition is required.

Features:

Real-time face detection and recognition using a webcam.

Customizable dataset for training the recognition model.

Uses OpenCV’s LBPH algorithm for robust face recognition.

Easy to integrate with any camera or webcam.

Lightweight and efficient, suitable for real-time applications.

Technologies Used:

Python

OpenCV

Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) algorithm

NumPy

dlib (optional, for face detection)
